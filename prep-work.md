# Prep Work

{% hint style='danger' %}
If this is your first time joining us for Coding & Cocktails, you'll want to [install our tools](http://bit.ly/CnCTheTools) before you go any further.
{% endhint %}

### 1. <a href="https://kcwit.slack.com/messages/C0BGBKGG6">Click Here to Open Slack</a>

If you have a tip that helped you with a step on the worksheet, you can easily share it with the group in Slack. Or if there are any issues with the worksheet [we make typos or there's an update to a tool that we didn't catch before the session], we may post updates in Slack. Plus, after class is over, Slack becomes a tool for you to gain access to mentors as you go through the homework, or any other questions that arise.

### 2. Pick a theme

A theme will help focus your work. This can be anything you can dream up but if you need some inspiration, here are some ideas to get your team talking. You don’t have to limit yourself to these.

* What you have learned at Coding & Cocktails

* Favorite Sports Team

* Favorite Hobby

* Team Website: Introduce who you are & what your team is about

* Build out a bar website with a tasty cocktail menu

* Personal portfolio site for craft projects

### 3. Draw a picture of what you want your site to look like

Before you start writing code, you should have an idea of the end game. Draw it out on paper so that your entire team knows what you are working towards. This can be both the look and feel and how the user should interact with and navigate the site, sometimes called a sitemap.

### 4. Set up a GitHub repository

As a team, create a new GitHub repository.

Share the repository with all team members including your mentor/technical architect.

Make sure each team member has the repository cloned to your local device in your CodingAndCocktails folder you created when you worked through the tools document.

#### Command line woes?
Revisit the command line worksheet from March:
[bit.ly/CnCMarWork](http://bit.ly/CnCMarWork)
  - Your home directory is:
    - Mac: `/users/<yourUsername>`
    - Windows: `C:/Users/<yourUsername>`
  - Command to change folders: `cd <folderToGoTo>`
  - Command to make a folder: `mkdir <newFolder>`
  - You can also use **~** as a shortcut in your CLI for your home directory: ``cd ~``
{% endhint %}

### 5. Choose one of three project models

For more details on how to proceed with each option see step 4 below

* **Option 1:** Using a template from [Templated.co](https://templated.co/) as a starting point, download the template and modify and style using HTML and CSS. Add some interactivity with JavaScript too!

* **Option 2:** Use a Yeoman scaffold like the one we used in the Front End Architecture session to build out your site.

##### Yeoman to the rescue!
Revisit the front-end architecture worksheet: [http://bit.ly/CnCMayWork](http://bit.ly/CnCMayWork)
  {% endhint %}

* **Option 3:** Build out a single page application similar to the trivia app we built in the session on SPA’s. You could start with the framework of the trivia app from the session worksheet and expand on it, or spin your own!

### 6. Divvy up the work and start building!

How you divvy up responsibilities is up to your team and what feels comfortable. Ask your mentor/technical architect about pair programming vs. Git collaboration. You will need to start with a GitHub repository for each project no matter what model you’ve chosen. This will make your team collaboration much easier!
