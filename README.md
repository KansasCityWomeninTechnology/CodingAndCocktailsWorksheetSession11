Coding &amp; Cocktails Session 15: Coding Camp ![](export/assets/image9png.png)codingcocktailsbadge-200.png

Overview

Tonight we are working on a team project as you would on a real-world development team. You will have a dedicated mentor who will serve as your technical architect for the night and will help your team build out a project from scratch.

Project

Keep it Simple! Work with your mentor (your team’s technical architect) to break up the tasks into smaller pieces. Make sure you take breaks! Walk around, clear your head. Have fun! This is not a competition.

Step 1: Pick a theme

A theme will help focus your work. This can be anything you can dream up but if you need some inspiration, here are some ideas to get your team talking. You don’t have to limit yourself to these.

*   What you have learned at Coding &amp; Cocktails

*   Favorite Sports Team

*   Favorite Hobby

*   Team Website: Introduce who you are &amp; what your team is about

*   Build out a bar website with a tasty cocktail menu

*   Personal portfolio site for craft projects

Step 2: Draw a picture of what you want your site to look like

Before you start writing code, you should have an idea of the end game. Draw it out on paper so that your entire team knows what you are working towards.

Step 3: Set up a GitHub repository

*   As a team, create a new GitHub repository.

*   Share the repository with all team members including your mentor/technical architect.

*   Make sure each team member has the repository cloned to your local device in your CodingAndCocktails folder you created when you worked through the tools document.

Step 4: Choose one of three project models

For more details on how to proceed with each option see step 4 below

*   **Option 1:** Using a template from [Templated.co](https://templated.co/) as a starting point, download the template and modify and style using HTML and CSS. Add some interactivity with JavaScript too!

*   **Option 2:** Use a Yeoman scaffold like the one we used in the Front End Architecture session in September to build out your site.

| **Yeoman to the rescue!**![](export/assets/image13png.png)plainicon.com-50337-512px-565.png |

*   **Option 3:** Build out a single page application similar to the trivia app we built in October’s session on SPA’s. You could start with the framework of the trivia app from the session worksheet and expand on it, or spin your own!

Step 5: Divvy up the work and start building!

How you divvy up responsibilities is up to your team and what feels comfortable. Ask your mentor/technical architect about pair programming vs. Git collaboration. You will need to start with a GitHub repository for each project no matter what model you’ve chosen. This will make your team collaboration much easier!

Option #1: Build a Website from a Template

*   Start here: [Templated.co](http://templated.co)

*   As a team, choose a template to download.

| **Helpful tip:** |
| --- |

*   Unzip the contents into your local directory.

*   Load these files into the Git repository you created above and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

*   Make sure each team member has the updated repository on their local device.

*   Decide how you want to add to and embellish your site. Divvy up tasks among your team members.

*   Modify the content (including but not limited to the _index.html_ file and its related CSS file). Some elements you might want to include:

    *   Headings (1-6)

    *   Paragraphs

    *   Lists (bulleted or numbered)

    *   Tables or forms

    *   Although you can experiment with inline formatting (remember and ?) remember that most of your formatting should happen in the CSS file.

*   Be sure to test all the functions of your page - hyperlinks, images, and buttons and ensure that they work correctly and have some functionality when the user interacts.

*   Try adding some jQuery to your page - maybe include a button that reacts when you click it by displaying a message.

*   Extra Credit: Add a section to your web site that includes a box slider

*   Feel free to add more pages to your site as well - a contact page, an about the team page, etc!

Option #2: Use Yeoman to scaffold a project:

*   Make sure you have Yeoman installed.

    *   You can confirm the installation by typing: **yo --version**

    *   If it is not found, in Git Bash (windows) or iTerm2 (macs), type: **npm install ​-g yo**

    *   To confirm installation type: **yo --version** again

*   Choose a generator to use for the nightThere are thousands, so feel free to browse and select the one that feels right to you but we’d suggest the option below. Instructions for how to download and install it are included within the Readme.md file of the GitHub repo.

    *   **Yeoman webapp generator** ([https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp))

*   Load these files into the Git repository you created above and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

*   Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

*   Choose some fonts from google fonts to use in your project

| **Helpful tip:** |
| --- |

*   Pick some images related to your theme and save them into the images folder. We suggest searching [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/) and change the filter from “Any license” to “Commercial use allowed”

*   Style your page with a _styles.css_ file. If you need help with color pallettes check out [https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest/](https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest/)

*   Select a library from npm and use it to add some functionality

    *   This could be using lodash ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)) to iterate over an array

    *   Maybe grab moment ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)) and display some relevant dates and times

    *   Create a simple graph or data vis with C3 ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/c3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c3))

    *   Bring in font-awesome for icons to use ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome))

*   *   Incorporate a box slider ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/bxslider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bxslider))

| **Need Inspiration ?**![](export/assets/image15png.png)201-512.png |

*   Add some interactivity (like a button or an effect) using jQuery or straight Javascript.

Option #3: Single Page App Project

For this project you can either start with the trivia quiz app we experimented with last month or you can try building your own single page application from scratch using Angular 2\.

The Trivia App

Using the October Single Page app worksheet as a starting point, download and modify the quiz app we worked on that night.

*   Have a team member fork [https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/trivia](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/trivia) and give other team members access so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

*   Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

*   Some ideas for ways you can modify the application include:

    *   Add Angular routing to your application and based on the route change the category of questions displayed using the [API](https://cocktail-trivia-api.herokuapp.com/) (See part 2 of the homework section of October’s worksheet linked below for hints!)

    *   Add another component for navigation (make sure you add an about page to navigate to!)

    *   Add images to make it more fun!

Spin your own with Angular CLI

Alternatively, you could build your own Angular 2 Single Page Application using Angular CLI.

*   Think about how your idea can be broken down into different components (this might look like a navigation component, a footer component, a drink list component, etc depending on what kind of application you’re wanting to build).

*   Have a team member scaffold the new app with Angular CLI and then push it to GitHub so everyone can contribute (See setup in the October SPA worksheet for Angular CLI Installation)

*   Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

*   Once you think you’ve identified the different components you need to build, start developing them and pulling them together and watch your application emerge!

Step 6: Show off what you have accomplished!

It doesn’t matter how far you get, we want you to show off your team’s efforts. Tell us what you found easier or tougher than expected. Tell us where you got stuck, or about an aha! moment you had!

*   Publish the project to GitHub Pages: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

    *   **For option 3 projects** see part 1 of the homework section of October’s worksheet linked above for a how-to.

*   Share the link to your project in slack ([kcwit.slack.com](http://kcwit.slack.com) in the #codingandcocktails channel!)
