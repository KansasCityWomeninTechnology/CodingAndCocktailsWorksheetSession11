# Option #1: Build a Website from a Template

1. Start here: [Templated.co](http://templated.co)

2. As a team, choose a template to download.

Mousing over the template offers the option to download
    {% endhint %}

3. Unzip the contents into your local directory.

4. Load these files into the Git repository you created during the prep work and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

5. Make sure each team member has the updated repository on their local device.

6. Decide how you want to add to and embellish your site. Divvy up tasks among your team members.

7. Modify the content (including but not limited to the _index.html_ file and its related CSS file). Some elements you might want to include:

    *   Headings (1-6)

    *   Paragraphs

    *   Lists (bulleted or numbered)

    *   Tables or forms

    *   Although you can experiment with inline formatting (remember `<span></span>` and `<em></em>`?) remember that most of your formatting should happen in the CSS file.

8. Be sure to test all the functions of your page - hyperlinks, images, and buttons and ensure that they work correctly and have some functionality when the user interacts.

9. Try adding some jQuery to your page - maybe include a button that reacts when you click it by displaying a message.
