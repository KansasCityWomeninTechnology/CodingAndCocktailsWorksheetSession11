Option #1: Build a Website from a Template

*   Start here: [Templated.co](http://templated.co)

*   As a team, choose a template to download.

| **Helpful tip:** |
| --- |

*   Unzip the contents into your local directory.

*   Load these files into the Git repository you created above and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

*   Make sure each team member has the updated repository on their local device.

*   Decide how you want to add to and embellish your site. Divvy up tasks among your team members.

*   Modify the content (including but not limited to the _index.html_ file and its related CSS file). Some elements you might want to include:

    *   Headings (1-6)

    *   Paragraphs

    *   Lists (bulleted or numbered)

    *   Tables or forms

    *   Although you can experiment with inline formatting (remember and ?) remember that most of your formatting should happen in the CSS file.

*   Be sure to test all the functions of your page - hyperlinks, images, and buttons and ensure that they work correctly and have some functionality when the user interacts.

*   Try adding some jQuery to your page - maybe include a button that reacts when you click it by displaying a message.

*   Extra Credit: Add a section to your web site that includes a box slider
