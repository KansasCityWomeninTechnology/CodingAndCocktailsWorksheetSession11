### Overview

Tonight we are working on a team project as you would on a real-world development team. You will have a dedicated mentor who will serve as your technical architect for the night and will help your team build out a project from scratch.

Keep it Simple! Work with your mentor (your teamâ€™s technical architect) to break up the tasks into smaller pieces. Make sure you take breaks! Walk around, clear your head. Have fun! This is not a competition.
