# Setup Instructions

{% hint style='danger' %}
If this is your first time joining us for Coding & Cocktails, you'll want to [install our tools](https://bit.ly/CnCTheTools) before you go any further.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %}
If you are borrowing a Coding & Cocktails laptop, you can skip the tools installation. All the tools you need are already installed for you. If you need to install a new tool on the laptop for tonight, please contact a member of the Coding & Cocktails leadership team.

Continue following the instructions on this page.

### 1. <a href="https://kcwit.slack.com/messages/C0BGBKGG6">Click Here to Open Slack</a>

If you have a tip that helped you with a step on the worksheet, you can easily share it with the group in Slack. Or if there are any issues with the worksheet [we make typos or there's an update to a tool that we didn't catch before the session], we may post updates in Slack. Plus, after class is over, Slack becomes a tool for you to gain access to mentors as you go through the homework, or any other questions that arise.

### 2. Pick a theme

A theme will help focus your work. This can be anything you can dream up but if you need some inspiration, here are some ideas to get your team talking. You don’t have to limit yourself to these.

* What you have learned at Coding & Cocktails

* Favorite Sports Team

* Favorite Hobby

* Team Website: Introduce who you are and what your team is about

* Build out a bar website with a tasty cocktail menu

* Personal portfolio site for craft projects

### 3. Draw a picture of what you want your site to look like

Before you start writing code, you should have an idea of the end game. Draw it out on paper so that your entire team knows what you are working towards. This can be both the look and feel and how the user should interact with and navigate the site, sometimes called a sitemap.

### 4. Set up a GitHub repository

As a team, create a new GitHub repository.

Add all team members as collaborators on the repository including your mentor/technical architect.

{% hint style='tip' %}
##### Git to it!
Revisit the version control worksheet: [bit.ly/CnCAprWork](https://bit.ly/CnCAprWork)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
Not sure how to add Git collaborators? [bit.ly/CnCGHCollab](https://bit.ly/CnCGHCollab)
{% endhint %}

Make sure each team member has the repository cloned to your local device in your CodingAndCocktails folder you created when you worked through the tools document.

{% hint style='tip' %}
#### Command line woes?
Revisit the command line worksheet from March:
[bit.ly/CnCMarWork](https://bit.ly/CnCMarWork)
  - Your home directory is:
    - Mac: `/users/<yourUsername>`
    - Windows: `C:/Users/<yourUsername>`
  - Command to change folders: `cd <folderToGoTo>`
  - Command to make a folder: `mkdir <newFolder>`
  - You can also use shortcuts in your CLI for your home directory
    {% codetabs name="iTerm2", type="bash" -%} 
cd ~
   {%- language name="Cmder", type="bash" -%} 
cd %USERPROFILE%
   {%- endcodetabs %}
     
{% endhint %}

### 5. Choose one of four project models

For more details on how to proceed with each option, view that specific options page in the GitBook.

* **Option 1:** Using a template from [Templated.co](https://templated.co/) as a starting point, download the template and modify and style using HTML and CSS. Add some interactivity with JavaScript too!

* **Option 2:** Use a Yeoman scaffold like the one we used in the Front End Architecture session to build out your site.

  {% hint style='tip' %}
##### Yeoman to the rescue!
Revisit the front-end architecture worksheet: [bit.ly/CnCMayWork](https://bit.ly/CnCMayWork)
  {% endhint %}

* **Option 3:** Build out a single page application similar to the trivia app we built in the session on SPA’s. You could start with the framework of the trivia app from the session worksheet and expand on it, or spin your own!

  {% hint style='tip' %}
##### Single Page Applications
Revisit the SPA worksheet: [bit.ly/CnCOctWork](https://bit.ly/CnCOctWork)
  {% endhint %}
  
* **Option 4:** Build out your code portfolio by making a contribution to an Open Source project.  Having this on your resume and the experience working with other developers on an existing project is a great way to show your skills and learn what it's like to be a developer on an existing project!

### 6. Divvy up the work and start building!

How you divvy up responsibilities is up to your team and what feels comfortable. Ask your mentor/technical architect about pair programming vs. Git collaboration. You will need to start with a GitHub repository for each project no matter what model you’ve chosen. This will make your team collaboration much easier!

<!-- Trick markdown to give a little extra space -->
## 
**Now that you've selected what project to tackle and your team is set up for success go ahead and dive in! Learn something, explore, collaborate and most of all - Have Fun!**

## Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet {#tips}

{% hint style='tip' %}
View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen. 

For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.

For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.

Mentors are happy to help!
