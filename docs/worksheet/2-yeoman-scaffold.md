# Option #2: Use Yeoman to scaffold a project:

1. Make sure you have Yeoman installed.

    *   You can confirm the installation by typing: `yo --version` in Git Bash (windows) or iTerm2 (macs)

    *   If it isn't found, in Cmder (windows) or iTerm2 (macs), type: `npm install ​-g yo`

    *   To confirm installation type: `yo --version` again

2. Choose a generator to use for the night. There are thousands, so feel free to browse and select the one that feels right to you but we’d suggest [Yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp). Download and install it by following the instructions within the Readme.md file of the GitHub repo.

3. Load the files into the Git repository you created above and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

4. Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

5. Choose some fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to use in your project

If you need some help choosing fonts that look nice together check out [fontpair.co](https://fontpair.co/).

Alternatively you can download fonts and add them to the fonts folder within your scaffolded project.

6. Pick some images related to your theme and save them into the images folder. Some good image sources include:

    * [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/): _change the filter from “Any license” to “Commercial use allowed”_
    
    * [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
    
    * [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)
    
    * [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/)

7. Style your page with a _styles.css_ file. If you need help with color palettes check out [color.adobe.com/explore/newest](https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest/) or [colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/)

8. Select a library from npm and use it to add some functionality

    *   This could be using lodash ([npmjs.com/package/lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)) to perform string functions

    *   Maybe grab moment ([npmjs.com/package/moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)) and display some relevant dates and times

    *   Create a simple graph or data visualization with C3 ([npmjs.com/package/c3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c3))

    *   Bring in font-awesome for icons to use ([npmjs.com/package/font-awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome))

9. Incorporate an image slider ([npmjs.com/package/tiny-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-slider))
