# Option 4: Contribute to Open Source

Be sure to read up on how to contribute to an Open Source project.  The projects will often contain a CONTRIBUTING.md file on how to go through the process.  Since the contribution can come from only one GitHub account you may want to consider each working on your own contribution but maybe to the same project.

1. Find a project to contribute to. Some good resources to browse for finding projects include: 

    * [GitHub issues tagged **first-timers-only**](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Afirst-timers-only+is%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=searchresults)
    
    * [up-for-grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/javascript)
    
    * [Codetriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
    
    * [Whatcanidoformozilla](https://whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/proglang/js/)
    
    * [Openhatch.org](https://openhatch.org/search/?language=JavaScript&q=)
    
    * [Codemontage](https://www.codemontage.com/projects?tags=JavaScript)

2. Select an issue to work on. Many projects will have issues tagged with **beginner-friendly** or **good-first-contribution** tags.

3. Develop the code for your contribution

4. Follow the contributing submission process for the project to contribute your code back to the project.

    Be sure you follow any testing and d standards the project sets forth!
