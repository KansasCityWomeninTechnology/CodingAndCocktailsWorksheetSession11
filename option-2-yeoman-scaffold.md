# Option #2: Use Yeoman to scaffold a project:

1. Make sure you have Yeoman installed.

    *   You can confirm the installation by typing: `yo --version` in Git Bash (windows) or iTerm2 (macs)

    *   If it is not found, in Git Bash (windows) or iTerm2 (macs), type: `npm install ​-g yo`

    *   To confirm installation type: `yo --version` again

6. Pick some images related to your theme and save them into the images folder. Some good image sources include:

    * [Yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)

2. Choose a generator to use for the night. There are thousands, so feel free to browse and select the one that feels right to you but we’d suggest the option below. Instructions for how to download and install it are included within the Readme.md file of the GitHub repo.

    * [Yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp)

3. Load these files into the Git repository you created above and push them up to GitHub so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

4. Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

5. Choose some fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to use in your project

Alternatively you can download fonts and add them to the fonts folder within your scaffolded project

6. Pick some images related to your theme and save them into the images folder. Some good image sources include:

    * [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/): _change the filter from “Any license” to “Commercial use allowed”_
    
    * [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)
    
    * [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)

7. Style your page with a _styles.css_ file. If you need help with color pallettes check out [color.adobe.com/explore/newest](https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest/) or [colorhunt.co](http://colorhunt.co/)

8. Select a library from npm and use it to add some functionality

    *   This could be using lodash ([npmjs.com/package/lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)) to iterate over an array

    *   Maybe grab moment ([npmjs.com/package/moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)) and display some relevant dates and times

    *   Create a simple graph or data visualization with C3 ([npmjs.com/package/c3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c3))

    *   Bring in font-awesome for icons to use ([npmjs.com/package/font-awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome))

9. Incorporate a box slider ([npmjs.com/package/bxslider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bxslider))
