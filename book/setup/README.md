# Prep Work

{% hint style='danger' %}
If this is your first time joining us for Coding & Cocktails, you'll want to [install our tools](https://bit.ly/CnCTheTools) before you go any further.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='danger' %}
If you are borrowing a Coding & Cocktails laptop, you can skip the tools installation. All the tools you need are already installed for you. If you need to install a new tool on the laptop for tonight, please contact a member of the Coding & Cocktails leadership team.

Continue following the instructions on this page.

### 1. <a href="https://kcwit.slack.com/messages/C0BGBKGG6">Click Here to Open Slack</a>

If you have a tip that helped you with a step on the worksheet, you can easily share it with the group in Slack. Or if there are any issues with the worksheet [we make typos or there's an update to a tool that we didn't catch before the session], we may post updates in Slack. Plus, after class is over, Slack becomes a tool for you to gain access to mentors as you go through the homework, or any other questions that arise.

### 2. Pick a theme for your project

A theme will help focus your work. This can be anything you can dream up but if you need some inspiration, here are some ideas to get your team talking. You donâ€™t have to limit yourself to these.

* What you have learned at Coding & Cocktails

* Favorite Sports Team

* Favorite Hobby

* Team Website: Introduce who you are and what your team is about

* Build out a bar website with a tasty cocktail menu

* Personal portfolio site for craft projects

* Contribute to an existing open source project

### 3. Draw a picture of what you want your site to look like

Before you start writing code, you should have an idea of the end game. Draw it out on paper so that your entire team knows what you are working towards. This can be both the look and feel and how the user should interact with and navigate the site, sometimes called a sitemap.

### 4. Set up a collaboration platform

As a team, decide on a collaboration platform. We recommend GitHub, a source code management tool (ask your mentor for help!), but you can use whatever you like. 

Add all team members as collaborators on the platform including your mentor/technical architect.

### 5. Find a template

Using a template from [Templated.co](https://templated.co/) as a starting point, download the template and modify and style using HTML and CSS. Add some interactivity with JavaScript too!

### 6. Divvy up the work and start building!

How you divvy up responsibilities is up to your team and what feels comfortable. Ask your mentor/technical architect about pair programming vs. Git collaboration.

**Now that you've selected what project to tackle and your team is set up for success go ahead and dive in! Learn something, explore, collaborate and most of all - Have Fun!**

## Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet {#tips}

{% hint style='tip' %}
View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen. 

For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.

For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.

Mentors are happy to help!
