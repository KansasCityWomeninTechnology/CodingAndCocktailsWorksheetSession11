Option #3: Single Page App Project

For this project you can either start with the trivia quiz app we experimented with last month or you can try building your own single page application from scratch using Angular 2\.

The Trivia App

Using the October Single Page app worksheet as a starting point, download and modify the quiz app we worked on that night.

*   Have a team member fork [https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/trivia](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/trivia) and give other team members access so the entire team can work from the same starting point.

*   Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

*   Some ideas for ways you can modify the application include:

    *   Add Angular routing to your application and based on the route change the category of questions displayed using the [API](https://cocktail-trivia-api.herokuapp.com/) (See part 2 of the homework section of October’s worksheet linked below for hints!)

    *   Add another component for navigation (make sure you add an about page to navigate to!)

    *   Add images to make it more fun!

Spin your own with Angular CLI

Alternatively, you could build your own Angular 2 Single Page Application using Angular CLI.

*   Think about how your idea can be broken down into different components (this might look like a navigation component, a footer component, a drink list component, etc depending on what kind of application you’re wanting to build).

*   Have a team member scaffold the new app with Angular CLI and then push it to GitHub so everyone can contribute (See setup in the October SPA worksheet for Angular CLI Installation)

*   Make sure all team members have the updated repository cloned to their local device and divvy up development tasks.

*   Once you think you’ve identified the different components you need to build, start developing them and pulling them together and watch your application emerge!
